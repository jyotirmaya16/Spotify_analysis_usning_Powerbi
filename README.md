# Spotify Songs Dashboard

## Project Overview

   - **Song Details**: A KPI chart showcasing the song name, artist name, sum of streams, release date, danceability percentage, speechiness percentage, liveness percentage, and the number of Spotify playlists the song is in.
   - **Dynamic Music Cover**: An HTML visual displaying the album cover image dynamically based on the data source link.

2. **Chart(2nd Dashboard)**
   - **Average Stream per Year**: A comparison of the average streams per year with the selected song's performance, color-coded to indicate whether the song is performing above or below average.
   - **Date-wise Song Streams**: A line chart showing the streams of songs over time.
   - **Energy Percentage**: A custom chart (Deneb Unichart) depicting the energy percentage of songs.
   - **Heat Map**: A heat map similar to GitHubâ€™s, displaying the distribution of streams.

3. **Filter Pop-up**
   - **Slicers for Filtering**: A dedicated section with slicers to filter the data dynamically.
   - **Return Button**: A button to close the filter pop-up and return to the main dashboard view.
